OVERVIEW: 

This App works on the Napster music API. The player show top Albums. The Player Screen allows user to Play / Pause , Skip next , Skip to Previous and forwarding and backwarding 5 secs.
Currently all the songs are played for 30 sec as I don't have the full access to the Napster Music library.


I will welcome suggestions and changes.
